pygbif modules
==============

`pygbif` is split up into modules for each of the major groups of API methods.

* Registry - Datasets, Nodes, Installations, Networks, Organizations
* Species - Taxonomic names
* Occurrences - Occurrence data, including the download API

You can import the entire library, or each module individually as needed.

Note that `GBIF maps API <http://www.gbif.org/developer/maps>`_ is not included in `pygbif`.
